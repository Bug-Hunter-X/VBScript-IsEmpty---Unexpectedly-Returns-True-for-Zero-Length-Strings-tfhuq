This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in VBScript's `IsEmpty()` function.  The function unexpectedly returns `True` for zero-length strings, which is different from the behavior of `IsEmpty()` in other languages. This can lead to unexpected behavior and errors in VBScript applications that rely on `IsEmpty()` to check for empty strings. The `bug.vbs` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.vbs` illustrates the corrected approach using the more reliable `param1 = "" ` check.
